Programming methodology that splits an application into 3 main components: Model, View, Controller - Separation of concerns

Model
  - Model = data
  - JSON, database data, etc

View
  - Used to display content & data to a user in a web browser
  - Uses HTML
  - Use expressions to insert data into views

Controllers
  - Control the functionality of our views
  - Performs the interaction between our models and views
  - Different controllers for different areas in our application

Example:
  - User clicks a 'show users' button in a view
  - The 'UserController' recognises the button click even and performs a function
  - The function communicates with the 'users' model and retrieves all user data
  - The controller passes accessibility to this data to the view which then displays it to the end user via expressions
